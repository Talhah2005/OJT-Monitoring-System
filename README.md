# On Job Training Monitoring System
The On-the-Job Training (OJT) Monitoring System is a comprehensive digital solution
tailored to monitor and manage trainees, supervisors, and training sessions in educational
and corporate environments. This system ensures structured management of attendance,
tasks, session progress, and overall trainee performance. With Flask as the backend
framework, SQL Server for relational data, and QR-based verification, this project
streamlines trainee lifecycle management.

QRcodes are displayed/downloaded from the trainee dashboard. The system is mobile
responsive and validates sessions via Flask-Login role filters.

# Future Expansion of the project
 • Add Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for extra security
 • Develop a Flutter/React Native mobile app
 • Addreal-time performance dashboards (trainee-wise KPI)
 • Deploy on Azure with CI/CD pipelines
 • Integrate analytics engine for automated feedback scoring
 • Build RESTful APIs for third-party integration
 • Adddocument uploads, feedback forms, supervisor review logs
 • Addfilters to search and analyze historical task performance
